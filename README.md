# python-scripts

This is just a series of python scripts that I make. Made for Python 2 and made to be run using the format: python NAME_OF_FILE.py.

autoIndentCode.py is a script I made for a friend who struggles to read code without indenting. Feel free to use it if you have access to something that will run Python and want to convert some code into something more readable.
